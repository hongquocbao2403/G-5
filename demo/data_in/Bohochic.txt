Title: Boho Chic Is Back. Again. How Did We Get Here?

Maybe it started with Jane Birkin on the beach at Cannes in 1969, wearing a white crocheted crop top and white jeans. Or maybe it was at Woodstock the same year, with those hippies in their colorful vests and tangles of beads. To be sure, Kate Hudson as Penny Lane, in that shearling-collar coat and those peasant blouses in 2000’s Almost Famous, which was set in the ’70s rock world, brought it all back into focus.
Boho fashion, in the contemporary sense, has murky origins. It only vaguely references the nomadic lifestyle of the Romani people for whom the French word bohemién was coined. (And that itself was a misattribution, because the Romani people did not originate from the Bohemia region in the Czech Republic.) It has taken on a you-know-it-when-you-see-it quality and usually includes some of the following elements: flowy, frilly layers; fringe; floral and paisley prints; abundant layered jewelry; and over-the-knee boots.

From Penny Lane in theaters, boho made its way to the small screen—with Blake Lively’s Serena van der Woodsen on Gossip Girl and Mischa Barton’s Marissa Cooper on The O.C.—and the street, where celebrity style was starting to become a phenomenon documented in real time by a new media format called blogs. The early-to-mid-’00s era—arguably the most important in terms of boho’s mass appeal—was also ruled by Nicole Richie in her oversize sunglasses and scarf headbands, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen in turquoise and broderie anglaise, and the unforgettable Kate Moss at Glastonbury and, well …  everywhere.
Now, here we are again, thanks to Chemena Kamali’s vibe-shifting debut as creative director of Chloé, where her interpretation of the storied label for Fall 2024 was exploding in sheer ruffled layers. To understand the phenomenon then and now, we went straight to the sources: the designers, stylists, and stars who helped shape our understanding of “boho chic” in the 2000s.

Anna Sui, designer: [Way before the 2000s,] Yves Saint Laurent was inspired by the hippies and Portobello Road and how everyone was dressing in London. Everyone was going to Portobello and buying the old velvet pieces or old parts of costumes. And I think that was just such a great revolution as far as how to dress.
Rachel Zoe, stylist: I think the catalyst at that time [in the early ’00s] was Phoebe Philo at Chloé. But I would say Stella McCartney is the queen of cool-girl boho chic. I remember going into her store in L.A. and pulling every day for my clients then. Isabel Marant was huge too, and Tom Ford at Gucci. To me, Tom Ford was, like, sexy bohemian glamour.
Tracy Feith, designer: There was just a moment [in the early 2000s] where I think there was a backlash to all the hardness of the ’90s fashion movements. Similar to what is happening now, people don’t want stiff or utilitarian. I think people want things that don’t look like everyone else, and people want soft.
Eric Daman, stylist, costume designer for Gossip Girl: For me, the first real explosion of boho back then was Jennifer Lopez at the Grammys in that Versace dress. That just kind of felt like an early catalyst and the precursor of what was to come.

Kate Hudson, actor: The early ’00s were pre–social media, and it was right at the boom of the paparazzi blogs. It was an accessible world you could be involved in, versus just looking at a magazine. I think at that moment, boho was a vibe, but I don’t think it had anything to do with Almost Famous. When you look at all of those pictures from that time, they look bohemian because people weren’t styled for the street the way they are now. There weren’t stylists for that or Pinterest boards to think, like, “Oh, does this look good with this?” You were really just getting a sense of people’s real personal style, and I think that’s why it felt bohemian.
Alexandra Welker, stylist, costume designer for season one of The O.C.: I can’t think of boho-chic style without thinking of Sienna Miller. She was so completely that girl. I loved all of those references she played with: All the fringe! And the handkerchief hems! And the silky, floaty fabrics! I’m a rock ’n’ roll girl at heart, even though I kind of came of age in a punk-rock era. But I love that just classic rock ’n’ roll look. Janis Joplin, Stevie Nicks, and of course Florence Welch of Florence + The Machine.

Zoe: I mean, the Kate Moss of it all, the Sienna of it all. I think that was the sort of London It girl group. But Kate Hudson was literally my bohemian soulmate sister and still is. On and off the carpet, I think Kate—in the most genuine, authentic way—is who she is. I always say she’ll forever be Penny Lane.
Hudson: Honestly, I think it was Kate Moss. When I was growing up, she was always my style icon. I was always and still am a much more flamboyant dresser than Penny Lane. I love sequins and accessories. I mean, please, I could have three bags on and be happy. I remember I’d just gotten off a plane, and my mom looked at me and she said, “I’m just wondering if you could put any more jewelry on your body?” And I looked at myself and was like, “Oh my God, I look nuts.”
Daman: Sienna Miller and Kate Moss at Glastonbury—those images were very strong in terms of styling. That look took logomania—the Juicy and Von Dutch we were seeing from Paris Hilton and the Hollywood girls—and turned it into this really amazing London-chic rocker-bohemian thing. When Kate did it, I definitely tapped into that vibe for Serena. Phillip Lim, Alexander Wang—they were all important for that look, as was Vena Cava.

Isabel Marant, designer: For me, boho is about a woman who travels and picks things up along the way, mixing and matching. She knows her tastes. Kate Moss is a great example. When she puts things together in her own way, it’s about freedom. I do feel like, at the time, I was a leader in this kind of movement. It’s how I’ve always dressed myself.
Welker: With Marissa [on The O.C.], I was always trying to support the fact that she was the ultimate insider, but she had an outsider’s perspective. And so there was this idea from the get-go with her to be a quintessential Southern California teenager but also have this kind of distinctive, sophisticated style of her own. The boho thing that was going on at the time yielded some really, really rich pieces. It’s actually funny, because in the last year, I’ve had a flurry of emails from people—mostly young women who were coming of age at the time—who were really inspired by [the boho looks from the show].

Hudson: When the whole Fashion Police thing was happening, best dressed and worst dressed, I just remember being like, “I don’t get it. This is just an expression.” You don’t have to like it, but personal expression is what makes great fashion; that’s how we get to the next great thing. I love bohemian fashion because it’s something deeply personal. It’s not just a look, it’s a way of seeing someone’s life and world.
Zoe: I think it’s a spirit. I think it’s an overall way that a woman carries herself. I think it’s beyond the clothes. I think the clothes and the jewelry and the sunglasses and the bag and all of that, that’s all just this sort of costume for the person. When I was styling Nicole [Richie] and styling Lindsay [Lohan] and styling Mischa [Barton], at the same time, I was styling Keira [Knightley], Salma Hayek Pinault, Jennifer Garner, and Eva Mendes, and some of these women were not that. At the time, I was very careful not to put anyone in boho if it wasn’t them. It’s about what feels most authentic to the person you’re dressing. The question was always, like, “Are you an Audrey Hepburn or a Brigitte Bardot?” and for me personally, it’s always Brigitte Bardot.

Daman: I think bandage dresses were also important. I do think it was about embracing your sexuality. I don’t think boho chic is all low-slung belts and peasant blouses. It’s about being, like, “Fuck it. I’m going to wear six chunky bracelets today and go out there and slay.”
Sui: I think that there’s an indulgence with the boho feeling. It’s kind of like living a fantasy, almost like playing dress-up. Now it’s time to bring back all those softer elements, after we’ve been through this whole sports look and quiet luxury and adapting menswear for womenswear. Suddenly, I think everyone is wanting a much more feminine approach to dressing. I think that we’ve been missing that lately. It all went too stark and too plain.
Marant: From what I’m observing, many people now are buying vintage. Every Instagrammer I see who is leaning into this trend is much more interesting to me than the ones who have all of those fake filters, the eyelashes, very polished. It’s very weird to me, because I think we’ve been fighting for women’s freedom and freedom of expression for so long, and I see images that are totally the reverse of what we were fighting for. They’re like—how do you say—plastic dolls? It’s not fresh. For me, boho is an attitude, a strength, and this power that comes from how you put things together.

Phong Cách Boho Chic - Nguồn Gốc Và Đặc Điểm Chung Của Style 
17/06/2024
Phong cách Boho Chic được nhiều tín đồ thời trang quan tâm và tìm hiểu vì những outfit theo style này mang đến cảm giác thoải mái, sự nổi bật vượt trội. Để tìm hiểu thêm thông tin chi tiết về Boho Chic và những điểm đặc trưng của chúng, bạn đừng bỏ qua bài viết tổng hợp nhanh dưới đây của IVYmoda nhé! 
Phong cách Boho Chic là gì? 
Boho Chic là phong cách thời trang kết hợp giữa Bohemian và Hippie, thể hiện sự phóng khoáng, kết nối với thiên nhiên. So với phong cách Boho thông thường, Boho Chic nghiêng nhiều về sự sang trọng và thời thượng hơn với những item thể nổi bật mà vẫn giữ được vẻ đẹp thanh lịch, hài hòa. 
Phong cách thời trang này ra đời sau Bohemian style nhưng nhanh chóng nhận được sự yêu thích của các tín đồ trên toàn thế giới. Trên thực tế Boho Chic không đi theo một quy chuẩn nhất định về sự sang trọng như phong cách Haute Couture nhưng cũng không nổi loạn như phong cách Punk.
Phong cách Boho Chic được yêu thích nhờ vẻ ngoài thanh lịch 
Chúng kết hợp hài hòa với những nét đặc trưng riêng, đặc biệt là không ngại việc để lộ “da thịt” hay các đường cong nóng bỏng. Theo một số nghiên cứu, phong cách Boho Chic ra đời từ những năm 1970, phát triển mạnh mẽ trong thập niên 70 đến 90 của thế kỷ XX. 
Sau đó dần bị các style nổi bật khác thay thế, mãi cho tới những năm 2004 Boho Chic được “phục hưng” bởi nhà tạo mẫu Rachel Zoe. Những outfit đặc trưng bởi sự tự do, nhiều màu sắc mà vẫn giữ được sự hài hòa. Cho tới hiện nay, Boho Chic luôn xuất hiện trong top những phong cách được yêu thích nhất bởi giới mộ điệu thời trang. 
Những điểm đặc trưng của Boho Chic hiện nay 
Một số đặc điểm quan trọng giúp bạn có thể dễ dàng phân biệt Boho Chic với những phong cách thời trang khác bao gồm:
Màu sắc tự nhiên 
Boho Chic có nhiều màu sắc đa dạng, không bị quy chuẩn với một màu sắc cố định nào. Thông thường gam màu chủ đạo của các thiết kế là nâu, màu đất hoặc vàng nâu,... Một số khác sẽ sử dụng xanh lá, xám hoặc xanh da trời, màu đỏ hoặc màu cam nhằm tạo nên sự nổi bật. 
Một item thường sử dụng nhiều màu sắc khác nhau để tạo sự nổi bật. Nhà thiết kế sẽ áp dụng quy tắc bánh xe màu sắc để có thể kế hợp nhiều gam màu mà không bị tương phản hay mất thẩm mỹ. Do đó hầu hết các trang phục theo phong cách Boho Chic đều rất hài hòa dù mix trên 3 màu trong cùng item. 
Sở hữu gam màu tự nhiên và nhẹ nhàng 
Layer trang phục  
Trang phục theo Boho Chic style sẽ được mix từ nhiều layer khác nhau để tạo cảm giác bồng bềnh, nhiều lớp. Nhiều người cho rằng việc này sẽ khiến cho outfit của bạn bị dày cộm và khó chịu tuy nhiên trên thực tế  hoàn toàn ngược lại. 
Do được làm từ chất liệu mỏng nhẹ nên hầu hết các item đều có đặc tính mềm mại và thoáng mát. Chính vì vậy ngay cả khi bạn mix nhiều trang phục lại với nhau cũng không gây ra tình trạng nóng bức hay chật chội như những mẫu thiết kế khác.

Những item họa tiết 
Một đặc trưng quan trọng khác của Boho Chic nằm ở họa tiết trên các thiết kế trang phục. Tất cả các item theo phong cách này đều sở hữu hoa văn hoặc họa tiết in/thêu trên bề mặt, không dùng các thiết kế trơn, đơn giản. 
Một số item không in họa tiết trên mặt vải sẽ thường đính kèm thêm các phụ kiện hoặc chi tiết viền trang phục để tạo điểm nhấn. Đây là nét độc đáo giúp cho outfit của tín đồ thời trang luôn cuốn hút mà không cần tốn nhiều công mix - match. 
Trang phục sở hữu nhiều họa tiết độc đáo 
Kết hợp chung với phụ kiện 
Để tạo nên một outfit Boho Chic hoàn chỉnh thì việc kết hợp thêm với phụ kiện là không thể thiếu. Thiết kế trang phục của style này có nhiều màu sắc và họa tiết chính vì vậy để cân bằng bạn không nên chọn phụ kiện với kiểu dáng quá cầu kỳ hay nổi bật. 
Nên ưu tiên item với thiết kế đơn giản, màu sắc trung tính nhất có thể để giúp outfit hài hòa hơn, không bị quá tương phản. Trong đó giày boot hoặc các đôi sandal, dép buộc dây là sự lựa chọn được rất nhiều Fashionista gợi ý. 
Mix - match cùng phụ kiện đi kèm 
Item thời trang không thể thiếu của Boho Chic 
Gợi ý một vài item thời trang không thể thiếu trong tủ đồ của bạn khi theo đuổi phong cách thời trang Boho Chic hiện nay: 
Các mẫu váy, đầm 
Đại diện điển hình nhất cho phong cách Boho Chic là những mẫu váy, đầm xòe bồng bềnh cùng nhiều màu sắc nổi bật. Họa tiết trên item cũng được thêu nổi hoặc in với màu sắc rực rỡ theo đúng tinh thần của style, thể hiện sự phóng khoáng và hòa mình với thiên nhiên. Trang phục phù hợp khi đi chơi, đi du lịch hoặc đi làm.

Title: The keys to boho chic style, a trend that is being reinvented
URL: https://shop.mango.com/gb/en/discover/trends/women/the-keys-to-boho-chic-style-a-trend-that-is-being-reinvented_blt4ef26bf56aadef45

Welcome back, boho style! Boho chic is on everyone's lips again, and this time it's not another TikTok achievement, but it comes straight from the latest catwalks. But, don't worry, the romantic and ornate bohemian style that you have engraved in your fashionista memory has been reinterpreted in 2024. Now it is fresh, it is modern and the coolest girls of the moment have been carried away by its spirit. If you're still not convinced, keep reading. Join us on this journey to discover the roots of boho chic and the essential garments that make it up.
What is boho chic style? Exploring its roots
The term boho chic is a combination of bohemian and chic. This style has its origins in the 1960s and 1970s, influenced by countercultural movements that sought to break away from established norms and celebrate freedom and creativity. Bohemian, or boho, this style is characterised by its carefree vibe, ethnic influences and love of natural elements. In essence, it is a celebration of free spirit and individuality.
The resurgence of boho chic in the 2000s is largely due to fashion icons such as Sienna Miller, Kate Moss and the Olsen twins. These figures were able to perfectly combine bohemian elements with modern and sophisticated touches, creating a style that quickly became a global phenomenon. Boho chic is not just a trend, but a way of life that celebrates authenticity, creativity and a connection with nature.
One of the most fascinating aspects of boho chic is its ability to adapt and evolve. Although its roots lie in the movements of the 1960s and 1970s, boho chic has managed to incorporate contemporary influences and remain relevant in today's fashion world. This versatility is precisely what makes it such an appealing and enduring style.
The must-haves for a boho chic look
Now that we understand what boho chic means and know its roots, it's time to delve into the essential elements that make up this style. We show you the essentials of a trend that has never really gone out of fashion. Ready to join its latest revival?
The colour palette of boho chic
The predominant colours in the bohemian style are earth tones, such as brown, beige and terracotta, which evoke nature and bring a sense of warmth and comfort. Don't worry, boho chic style also allows for colour, but it should be in the tertiary range, i.e. softer colours such as pale pink, sky blue and mint green.
Maxi dresses
If you're new to the boho trend, but ready to dive right in, the first item you should go for is a maxi dress in light tones. With its fluidity and lightness, this garment evokes a romantic and carefree air. Opt for designs with floral prints, ethnic motifs and earthy colours. Crochet dresses or dresses with lace details, or even printed shirts with bright colours are also an excellent choice.
The predominant colours in the bohemian style are earth tones, such as brown, beige and terracotta.
Bell-bottom trousers
Although maxi dresses are the kings of women's boho chic, bell-bottoms are not far behind. Iconic in 70s fashion, they are back with a vengeance and are perfect for creating a boho chic and retro look. Pair them with a loose blouse and a fringed waistcoat for a spectacular outfit. Opt for printed and lightweight designs that allow you to move freely.
Waistcoats for an unforgettable boho chic look
Waistcoats are key pieces to give a bohemian touch to any romantic style outfit. Embroidered, fringed or with colourful patches, waistcoat outfits are perfect for adding texture and depth to your boho chic style ensemble.
Handcrafted accessories
When it comes to accessories we go for the eye-catching, such as a wide, low-waisted belt. They will help give dimension and personality to your outfit, especially if you're wearing flowing garments. Wide-brimmed hats, flower headbands, beaded necklaces and leather bracelets are essential for that bohemian, carefree look.
Crochet and lace garments
To talk about bohemian style is to talk about crochet. This fabric always makes an appearance in summer, but its more irreverent and revealing version will win you over. Its texture adds a romantic and delicate touch, ideal for creating interesting contrasts in a boho chic look. Opt for crochet tops to combine with denim shorts or choose lace dresses for a more feminine outfit. Both options are versatile and will allow you to play with different combinations.
Sunglasses and bandanas in bohemian style
Extra-large, round sunglasses, typical of the boho chic style, are a must-have accessory. Bandanas and scarves can also be worn in many different ways: as headbands, tied around the neck or even as bracelets. These little details will make your look even more interesting and complete.
The charm of boho chic jewellery
Jewellery plays a crucial role in a woman's boho chic style. Opt for big, bold pieces, such as long necklaces with natural stone pendants, large rings and maxi earrings. The key is in the mix of materials: wood, metal, leather, fringes and semi-precious stones are ideal to achieve that bohemian and handmade look.
In conclusion, the boho chic style has managed to reinvent itself as a trend for spring-summer 2024, remaining a relevant option throughout the years. So, the next time you are preparing your look for a music festival or simply want to incorporate a bohemian touch to your wardrobe, remember these keys and let your free spirit express itself through fashion.

Title: The Boho Chic Style.

LITTLE WOMEN SET THE TREND
Greta Gerwig’s Little Women was released in December. It’s the seventh film adaptation of one of the most beloved novels of all time written by Louisa May Alcott 150 years ago, and it’s already set to be one of this year’s most memorable fashion moments. In this film, the March sisters don’t just give lessons in life, style, and etiquette, but are also unexpected fashion influencers. Jo, Meg, Beth, and Amy’s clothes reflect the boho chic trend that has been all the rage both on the runways and on the road: long, high-neck dresses, circle skirts, cotton blouses, lace-up ankle boots, pastel colors, and lots of flowers. Last spring, online searches for prairie dresses, which resemble the long-sleeve dresses with circle skirts worn in the mid-19th century, had increased by 38%, followed by an incredible surge in purchases.
WHAT DOES BOHO CHIC MEAN? Boho is short for bohemian and results from different inspirations and styles, from nonconformist 19th-century artists to the hippie style of the 70s, with an extra touch of romanticism. The pioneer style will also be the trend for the 2020 spring/summer and the beauty look for hedonist brides who love simplicity and light shapes and fabrics. The boho chic style is characterized by flowy skirts, waistcoats, embroidered tunics, cropped jackets, cowgirl boots, oversized cardigans, rigid bracelets, amulets and raffia.
THE BOHO CHIC STYLE Many brands have translated this style into creations. Think of Saint Laurent’s embroidered tunics; Atlein’s long draped saris; Isabel Marant’s jumpsuits, denim overalls, crochet blouses and floral waistcoats; or Molly Goddard’s circle skirts embellished with soft tulle flounces, velvet bows, puffed sleeves, and trapeze silhouettes, for romantic women who know what they want. And then, there are the accessories: gladiator sandals with gold studs; suede fringe boots; bucket and mini bags; necklaces with magic, esoteric or religious symbols; maxi hoop earrings decorated with multi-color stones, such as those by Aurelie Bidermann and Marco Bicego; round, colored sunglasses, straw hats, and belts with inlaid buckles and metal applications.
BOHO HAIRSTYLES And what about hair? Down dos for sure, although they’re not the only option. Deconstructed buns with strands falling on the sides of the face, braids and dreads, true expressions of a hippie chic style, are also in.
Fashion is always reinventing itself, and even the March sisters’ nineteenth-century outfits become contemporary and an alternative to athleisure and streetwear.
