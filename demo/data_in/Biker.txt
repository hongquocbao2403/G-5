THE ENDURING APPEAL OF BIKER FASHION
WRITTEN BY RICCARDO ZAZZINI
9 MONTHS AGO IN STYLE

Trends come and go; that’s the nature of fashion. But when the bikercore trend started taking shape a few years ago, it was clear that it would be more than just a fleeting moment. Now, as we enter 2024, biker fashion is still firmly at the forefront of fashion. 
Biker fashion, or bikercore, took the scene by storm in 2022. Rosalía's album Motomami, epitomized the style, blending elements of motorsports with high fashion. Her custom bike helmet with devil-like horns, paired with Pepa Salazar's asymmetrical dresses, is a prime example of this fashion fusion.
The appeal of motorcycling fashion lies not just in leather jackets or biker jeans but encompasses an entire aesthetic that has permeated the broader style spectrum. From high fashion to high street, the influence is undeniable. 
While biker and motorsport essentials, like leather jackets and graphic T-shirts, have long-inspired designers, it seems that a lot of fashion choices nowadays are about creating  pieces that look straight out of a motorsport shop rather than a luxury department store.
What exactly is biker fashion ?
In essence, the bikercore style features a mix of motorcycle jackets, fringe detailing, retro band t-shirts, boots adorned with studs, handbags reminiscent of the Y2K era, and jeans with embellishments.
While leather is a central element of this trend, it also incorporates a variety of other fabrics and materials, including a significant use of denim.

2022: Where it all started
Throughout the fall 2022 runways, the on-the-run spirit was exhibited through a contrast of the edgy and the soft: delicate black mini dresses paired with utilitarian gloves at Dior, a leather jacket that opened into a ballgown skirt at Junya Watanabe, and cropped moto jackets paired with flowy skirts at Alexander McQueen. 
What truly made 2022 a special year in the ascent of biker fashion was that it was all about texture and mixing materials. Distressed knits could be found over silk or a moto jacket and leather pants, or big sunglasses over, literally, anything.
2023-2024: The consolidation
The recent Fall/Winter 2023 fashion shows have witnessed the rising popularity of the bikercor trend, characterized by a fascination with motorcycle-inspired fashion. 
In 2023 , major fashion houses have embraced the motorcore craze, with Jil Sander showcasing branded motorcycle looks, complete with leather jackets and trousers. Balenciaga, Gucci, and Ottolinger have also incorporated racing styles into their FW23 collections, reflecting this trend.
The motorcore trend, fueled by brands like Diesel and celebrities like Ye, Rosalía, and Bella Hadid, is not just about clothing but extends to accessories like motorcycles, as seen in collaborations by AMBUSH with Nike, and Palace with Gucci. 
Last but not least, Kim Kardashian was seen wearing an Alpinestars Upcycled Racer Jacket in leather and 5G sunglasses in black bio-based injected nylon from Balenciaga’s  Summer 24 collection. 
Throughout 2023, the fusion of luxury fashion with motocross boots and racing jackets, partly driven by TikTok trends, fully established biker fashion as  a bold new direction in fashion.
In the summer of 2024, during the legendary Glastonbury Festival in England, Little Simz rocked the stage not just with her immense talents on the mic but also with a custom red and white biker jacket with her stage name written at the front.

Here’s how to channel the bikercore trend, on and off the road. 
Racing Jacket Fashion
For a biker-inspired look, a leather jacket is a necessity. Preferably on the more shiny and dyed leather jackets, these tough garments are made to both protect you and to look great.
Even if you don't own a motorbike, they'll make you look like you do.  
If you don't know where to start, the genderless fashion line by Korean photographer Cho Gi-Seok KUSIKOHC is a good places to look.

When it comes to footwear, another easy way to channel the bikercore look is through chunky boots, such as  Balenciaga’s motocross boots or UGG x Shayne Oliver. 
If the price points are too prohibitive, then opting for a rugged look will be just fine.
Trousers
Wear the trousers with a tough, rough pair of jeans. Leathers aside, jeans are another garment that would resonate in a motorsports look. Like the jackets above, denim will have a stronger look as it ages and fades — so long as you invest in a sturdy pair to begin with.

Biker fashion has a vibrant and ornate history, which is why for centuries; bikers have had to wear the best clothes they can afford. Luckily, many affordable options still look great in biker style. This guide will tell you everything you need to know about dressing like a biker in any situation or occasion.
The Leather Jacket
An essential piece of clothing when it comes to biker fashion is your leather jacket. This timeless garment should fit snugly around the torso and arms. It should be in as good a condition as possible because even if you buy one new, leather jackets eventually form character over time due to their natural softening process that occurs after each use.
When looking for a good biker fashion leather jacket, you should look for an animal or textured leather. Take better care of your leather jacket and keep it in pristine condition to make sure that it lasts a long time. Also, if you're riding a motorcycle or driving, always wear your helmet matching the color of your bike.

However, this can be easily solved when you go online and check out all kinds of different colors, styles, and prices from different manufacturers online.
The Motorcycle Boots
You don't have to wear a leather jacket or even a complete set of leathers all the time, but you should be able to wear your motorcycle boots. These are designed specifically for motorbike riding and look great as part of your biker fashion. They should go halfway up your calf and match the rest of your outfit.
If you're buying new, make sure that they're made from quality materials and that they last long. However, if you're looking for good cheap motorcycle boots online, there are plenty of affordable options with many different styles.
The Biker Fashion Pants
3) Your pants should be comfortable, tough, durable, and made of the best quality. They should also match the rest of your outfit and ideally be of leather or a piece of thick fabric. If you're stuck for ideas on how to tick all these boxes, Biker Jeans are a great option or drill pants famous for years.
The Biker Fashion Coat
A great coat is another key part of biker fashion. Ideally, it will match the rest of your outfit and look great when you wear it on your motorcycle riding with either friends or family. A good biker should make a good biker fashion coat from leather, including other fabrics, just as long as they feel warm and comfortable. You can get excellent biker fashion coats from prominent car makers like BMW, Harley Davidson, and even Mercedes Benz.
A good scarf
This is another essential piece of biker fashion. Popular options include the 'old school' style scarf worn over the shoulder and tied up in a knot. Another kind is a tie-around-the-neck scarf or just a bandanna which you can use to cover your mouth in colder weather conditions.
Accessorizing for You
Motorcycle Gloves
In terms of accessories, you should invest in a quality set of motorcycle gloves. Ideally, they should come with an open back so that they're easy to get on and off and match the rest of your outfit. If you have a jacket, you should also consider wearing some chaps or open-back leather pants designed to be worn with motorcycle riding gear.
Assorted Rings and Necklaces
You should also wear an assortment of rings and necklaces that look good when you're riding a motorbike. Biker fashion rings usually include skulls, the American flag, and other popular symbols among bikers. The same goes for necklaces, but they can also be made from different metals like silver and gold. If you want to learn more about different styles of rings, there are plenty of style guides online.
A Biker Vest
Just like any other fashion accessory, a biker vest is a cheap add-on to your biker style. It looks great when you ride outdoors, but it also works well when you're riding on the street. Biker fashion vests can be made from leather, but they're usually made from cheaper and lighter materials so that they're not too heavy if you want to know more about buying good quality leather vests.
Bottomline
Biker fashion is a rich and intricate part of the style that has been evolving over many years. If you want to look at the business, you should look into getting all the right accessories and finding affordable biker fashion online.

Title: "Tất tần tật" về Biker fahion
URL: https://kenh14.vn/fashion/tat-tan-tat-ve-biker-fahion-20110122105426824.chn

Tất tần tật những gì bạn cần biết về xu hướng thời trang khỏe khoắn và cực kỳ phong cách này.
Biker fashion: Xu hướng thời trang cho cô nàng cá tính
Trong bài viết này, hãy cùng chúng tớ tìm hiểu xem những gì làm nên xu hướng thời trang Biker fashion hết sức cá tính và phong cách này nhé!






Những nhân tố làm nên xu hướng Biker fashion cho teengirl
Áo khoác da (Motorcycle jacket)
Bạn có thể hình dung xu hướng thời trang quân đội (military trend) mà thiếu đi những chiếc áo khoác xanh lá đặc trưng hay không? Biker fashion cũng vậy, tạo hình trang phục của bạn sẽ không được coi là Biker fashion nếu thiếu đi những chiếc áo khoác da. Có thể nói, những chiếc áo khoác da này chính là nhân tố chính và chủ đạo nhất của xu hướng thời trang motorcycle hay biker fashion. 





Về cơ bản, những chiếc áo khoác da đặc trưng của những tay đua thường mang màu đen thế nhưng, trong xu thế thời trang biker fashion 2011, bạn sẽ thấy xuất hiện những chiếc áo khoác da mang màu sắc tươi sáng và đa dạng. 




Không chỉ vậy, BST của Burberry Prorsum còn đem lại cho chúng ta những chiếc áo khoác da hai gam màu (two-tone leather jacket) rất độc đáo và ấn tượng.




Tất nhiên, nếu chỉ nói đến chất liệu và màu sắc của những chiếc áo khoác thì sẽ là một thiếu sót. Hãy điểm qua những kiểu dáng áo khoác lạ mắt và không kém phần phá cách trong BST xuân/hè của Balmain để có một cái nhìn tổng quan hơn về xu hướng áo khoác da của phong cách thời trang Biker fashion này nhé!!








Tạo điểm nhấn bằng khóa kéo
Nếu zoom kỹ hơn vào các chi tiết trên những chiếc áo khoác da này, bạn sẽ thấy, không chỉ là những chiếc áo khoác da đơn thuần, Biker fashion rất chú trọng vào những điểm nhấn như khóa kéo được thiết kế nhiều hơn ở cổ tay, thân áo và túi quần.




Và thiết kế trần bông
Không chỉ vậy, những chiếc áo khoác da này cũng được bổ sung những điểm nhấn mềm mại và nữ tính hơn với các thiết kế trần bông.







Quần da (Leather pants)
Bạn có thể nghĩ rằng những chiếc quần của xu hướng Biker fashion sẽ mang những đặc trưng ôm sát và tối màu thông thường. Tuy nhiên, nếu quan sát các BST trên sàn catwalk xuân/hè 2011 thì điều này chưa hẳn là chính xác. Những thiết kế của quần da của Christopher Bailey cho BST của Burberry đã thực sự gây được sự chú ý bởi màu sắc tươi sáng và những thiết kế khóa kéo rất độc đáo. 










Lựa chọn thay thế với váy da
Cũng trong xu hướng Biker chic này, bạn có thể thấy những nét nữ tính đã được quan tâm khi BST không chỉ xuất hiện những thiết kế quần da mà còn xuất hiện những thiết kế váy da hết sức sáng tạo và cá tính. Cũng với cảm hứng trần bông của những thiết kế áo khoác, những chiếc váy da trần bông sẽ trở thành những kết hợp hoàn hảo thay thế quần da trong xu hướng thời trang Biker.





Boots da (Motorcycle boots)
Boots da cũng là một nhân tố không thể thiếu làm nên xu hướng thời trang Biker chic. Bạn cũng có thể kết hợp những chiêc quần da skinny với những đôi sandal cao gót và cũng có thể kết hợp chúng với những đôi boots da để trông thật đúng điệu. 





Những nhân tố làm nên xu hướng Biker fashion cho teenboy

Thông thường, những xu hướng thời trang cho teengirl không mấy khi có thể hòa hợp và xuất hiện cũng lúc với xu hướng thời trang cho teenboy. Thế nhưng, Biker fashion lại là một ngoại lệ. Bạn có thể thấy chỉ với một chiếc áo khoác da nạm đinh hay áo khoác da  kéo khóa kết hợp cùng những chiếc quần khaki tối màu thì theo một cách nào đó, teenboy cũng đang hòa nhập với xu hướng thời trang Biker fashion rồi.

Title: THE ULTIMATE BIKER FASHION GUIDE
URL: https://www.attitudeclothing.co.uk/blog/the-ultimate-biker-fashion-guide/

Biker fashion has an unmistakable connection to the alternative scene. From the rebellious spirit of the biker lifestyle to the inspiration from biker gear that’s seeped into alternative fashion staples, biker fashion is forever intertwined with punk and rock style.
But where did biker fashion come from? Which alternative symbols came from biker culture? How do you get the biker look for your wardrobe? We’ll answer all these questions and more in our ultimate biker fashion guide!
The History of Biker Fashion
A Gentleman’s Activity
Biker fashion was quite a dapper look when it started out. This was because owning a motorcycle was quite the expense! Only men of means could afford such a luxurious mode of transportation, and dressed to impress while they were out on the country roads.
Biker fashion was therefore pretty heavily tweed based, since that was the most popular menswear style at the time! But motorcycles were getting faster, and soon it was clear that additional protection was needed. 
By the early 20th century, motorcycles had been adopted by the police and the military as their main mode of transport. As part of their uniform, riders would wear full length boots, a flat cap and gauntlet gloves that protected them from harsh winds – many of which are still staples of the gentrified country wardrobe! But where did the biker look we know and love on the alternative scene come from?
A Need For Speed (And Protective Gear!)
Well, the faster motorcycles got, the more the need for protection grew! Military overcoats made from horsehide in the World War I era were adopted by bikers, but these coats were cumbersome and made maneuvering while on the road difficult.
A jacket maker from New York City changed all this in 1928 when he created the first ever leather jacket specifically designed for motorcycles! Irving Schott named his design after his favourite cigar, the Perfecto, and the leather jacket synonymous with motorcycles and biker culture was born. The first iteration of the Perfecto was a fitted leather jacket that could zip up high, featured lapels, snaps and pockets – all the iconic features of the leather jackets we know and love today.
For the English, the toughness of leather jackets wasn’t enough protection on its own. English weather meant that keeping out the rain was essential, so in 1935 the brand we now know simply as Barbour created a wad-cotton jacket for motorcyclists guaranteed to keep out rainwater. Famously worn by motorcyclists including Ewan McGregor and Steve McQueen, the wad-cotton featured four pockets, one of which was angled to the upper left to hold a map and is now as an iconic part of biker fashion as the leather jacket! 
A Boot Engineered For Protection
So what about footwear? Around the 30s, a style called the engineer boot emerged. The engineer boot took the classic shape of the English riding boot and fitted it with a stovepipe leg. The style was designed primarily for engineers working on America’s railroads during the infamous Depression era, but in the 40s it was adopted by motorcyclists looking for a tough pair of protective boots to take out on their ride.
The 1950s Rebel Biker 
While biker fashion had previously been all about practicality, the tides turned in the 1950s when Marlon Brando starred as the leader of the Black Rebels Motorcycle Club in the film ‘The Wild One’. Sporting a black leather Perfecto jacket, a pair of blue jeans and engineer boots, Brando’s biker uniform inspired generations of rebels, musicians and outlaws for years to come! The popular look was even adopted by the British “ton-up” boys, an important part of British motorcycling culture.

Hells Angels Fashion
Among the rebels inspired by Brando’s look were bikers that would go on to form clubs like the Hells Angels MC in the 1960s. The Hells Angels modified the leather jacket by removing the arms and creating a motorcycle vest (also known as Cuts) from either leather or denim. 
With the sleeves removed, bikers gained increased arm mobility and better ventilation in the warmer USA climate! As the popularity of Cuts grew, outlaw bikers and MCs alike embellished their motorcycle vests with their MC name and symbols. Aside from being a quick way for MC members to identify each other out on the road, owning a motorcycle vest with your MC name showed your commitment to the biker lifestyle and, depending on what was on your cut, your experience as a rider.

Perfecto Goes Punk
The popularity of the Schott Perfecto leather jacket only grew throughout the 70s, and soon enough it’s reputation for being a symbol of the outlaw lifestyle was adopted by the Punk scene. Bands such as the The Ramones and The Sex Pistols were among the first punk rockers to make the Perfecto jacket a staple part of their look and soon the black leather jacket was synonymous with the punk scene. 
While many punk rockers wore their leather jackets as is, many loved the DIY element of punk culture and customised their jackets with spikes, patches and studs to exaggerate their look and take it to a new, anti-establishment vibe! 
Racing Through the 80s
The popularity of motorcycle racing and the rise of sports bikes saw biker fashion take a detour through the 80s. The bomber jacket style was adopted for leather jackets in a deviation from the classic Perfecto style. However, the Schott Perfecto design won out in the end and with the popularity of vintage style in the 2000s, the classic leather jacket once again became the alternative scene staple it once was!
The Symbolism of Biker Fashion
Biker history focuses mostly on the leather jacket, but what about the patches stitched onto those jackets? Motorcycle gangs are notorious for the detailing on their motorcycle vests – from the MC name to the symbols and patches, there’s meaning behind every detail that can denote all kinds of things from MC rank to experience and more.
While themes vary, the skull is present in most biker symbolism – in wider culture, the skull represents death and mortality, and can even be a sign of danger or death. For bikers, the symbol unifies them and serves as an unspoken commitment to biker life and the thrill of the open road. 
The idea is that once a biker, always a biker. While the skull absolutely represents the rebellious spirit and tough attitude of the wearer, it’s also used as a reminder to not with harm or death to others and to respect and accept one’s own mortality. Pretty deep stuff!
Is The Biker Look Fashion or Function?
Function! Bikers don’t care about fashion trends, they just want the best gear for the job. However, what is functional to a motorcycle gang has heavily influenced alternative fashion for many years.
The biker fashion trend blends traditional rock and roll style with modern biker gear. Think denim jeans with a skull emblazoned t-shirt, leather jacket featuring studs and spikes and accessories to match and a solid pair of ankle boots.. Soon you’ll have a tough biker fashion look that’ll make sure no-one’s messing with you!
How To Style Biker Fashion
If you’re looking to put together a biker fashion look, let’s take a closer look at the main elements you’ll need…
The Leather Biker Jacket
The most iconic part of the biker look, if you’re wanting to invite biker fashion into your wardrobe you’ll need to invest in a leather jacket. Our leather jackets at Attitude clothing are designed in the Perfecto style and come either unembellished or packed with studs and skulls to increase the punk biker vibe.
The Biker Jeans
Blue jeans were a classic part of the Marlon Brando era biker look – but as with all alternative fashion, there’s room for customisation here. In our collection of jeans, you’ll find a huge range of styles from plain black to punk tartan and more so you can style your biker look your way!
The Biker Boots
Your biker boots should be made from tougher stuff and should ideally be flat boots if you’re going for an authentic biker fashion look. If you’re just wanting to take the biker influence and dress it up for a night out, feel free to indulge in a pair of heeled boots or platform boots for an alternative edge! 

Biker fashion is a close relation of punk style, so if you’re looking to perfect your look make sure to check out our full punk collection here at Attitude Clothing!!
